<p>The Academia Sinicaâ€™s 112th Annual Science Popularization Award Ceremony invited Distinguished Researcher Ma Guofeng to share seismic monitoring technology, and introduced the research on using optical fiber to observe seismic waves, which can provide high-resolution seismic signals and analyze them in combination with big data. Taiwan has established a national seismic wave database to quickly obtain earthquake information. In the future, we will focus on more effectively feeding back earthquake information to the society, broadcasting the intensity of the earthquake to the location in real time, and actively developing communication-related work. In addition to seismic observations, fiber optic technology has other applications, such as energy exploration and geothermal carbon storage. The Earthquake Science Center conducts seismic modeling studies and simulates basin structures to clearly see changes in seismic wave propagation. The researchers studied the Cheung Chau subsidence-type earthquake that could potentially trigger house collapses, explored the process of seismic acceleration, and hoped to develop predictive models to understand the behavior of magnitude 7.0 earthquakes. The potential of optical fiber technology in the field of earthquake research is considered to help improve the accuracy of disaster prevention and early warning. The speaker emphasized the importance of information disclosure to improve risk management capabilities, and indicated that the earthquake research project may be extended to other fault areas in the future. The speaker mentioned that he hoped to use Chunghwa Telecom&rsquo;s signal to understand the location of faults in order to meet the challenges in earthquake research. Although the research on the earthquake risk map and tsunami potential map has been questioned, the research team still has the opportunity to cooperate with TSMC, which shows that the scientific research results have practical application value. Ideally, seismographs would be deployed inside buildings and reduced costs in order to collect more data. In addition, seismic technology also has potential applications in forward-looking energy planning and earthquake insurance, which is helpful for risk control. Finally, the speaker thanked the audience who participated in the humanities lecture, and looked forward to applying the results of earthquake research to people&rsquo;s livelihood. ,</p>

<p>The theme of this academic lecture is the evolution of Chinese characters, and it will be lectured by Academician Cheng Yue-e, Chair Professor of National Taiwan University. Academician Zheng has made rich achievements in the study of Chinese characters, combining Pentateuch literature with modern Western literature. The film mentions that language is not just a tool, but has diversity in different eras, backgrounds and contexts. In the 1930s, Louis Mumford mentioned changes in the perception of space and time in Technology and Civilization. In addition, the film mentions the choice of definitions and polysemy in the New Encyclopedia of General Encyclopedia, which may make people lose their understanding of the overall structure. Inspired by his experience in teaching Chinese characters, Hu Shi advocated that Chinese should have grammar, and later published &ldquo;On the Reform of Guoyu Grammar&rdquo;, which raised the vernacular movement to a higher level. This film tells about the reform of Chinese grammar and punctuation marks, and emphasizes that we should not imitate the West, but break through the limitations of grammar and morphology when researching and creating language. In addition, the film explores the importance of rhetoric in language learning, including meaning categories of words, word-making structures, and linguistic diversity and emotional expression. Through Tang Yue&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rhetorical Revolution&rdquo;, it is proposed that the grammar of reform should conform to grammatical principles and be able to touch emotions. The film also discusses the issues of language change and part-of-speech division in Chinese, and emphasizes the importance of grammar and logic in Chinese and the relationship between language and thought and things. Finally, it introduces the teaching and comprehension methods of language and poetic language science, emphasizing the close reading of the text to understand the semantics, and pointing out the complexity of the psychological structure of the speaker or writer. The film tells how Chinese culture continues to evolve and transform in the modern revolution, emphasizing language diversity and emotional expression. In order to re-understand the essence of Chinese culture, we need to break the framework of modern vision and explore the issue of language diversity. In the process of modern exploration of Chinese poetry, poets have tried many different transformation methods. Language is not only a tool, but also an organ that shapes inner thoughts. In the face of language transformation, we need a language of logical cognition, and at the same time seek a language that integrates across fields, emphasizing the empathy function of language. The development of the Chinese language does not only belong to a certain era or region, but is the result of a civilization that is constantly undergoing transformation. ,</p>

<p>At the popular science lecture held by the Academia Sinica in 2023, Wang Zhiming, an associate researcher at the European and American Institute, shared a special speech on power, freedom and dignity with the theme of refugees. The speech discussed the issue of refugee documents, the plight of Afghan refugees and human rights protection laws, and borrowed literature perspectives such as the experience of Vietnamese refugees and books on North Korean refugees to remind everyone to respect the dignity of refugees and the right to pursue freedom. The speaker called for an in-depth investigation of the concept of immigration and caring for refugees, to enhance Taiwan&rsquo;s discussions and actions on refugee issues, and ultimately look forward to combining academic research and practical actions to promote social harmony. This film mainly discusses the refugee issue, analyzes the differences in European attitudes towards different refugee issues, emphasizes the need for more cooperation between the academic and food circles, and pays attention to ethics and morality. When faced with issues such as terrorist attacks, viewers are encouraged to think about the reasons behind the events rather than focusing on specific identities. In addition, the film refers to the differences in the situation of refugees in Europe, the Americas and Asia, and explores issues related to refugee identity and transnational migration. Finally, the speaker called for understanding the real situation of refugees and respecting the special situation of each country. ,</p>

<p>This video is to celebrate the 130th anniversary of the birth of Dean Zhu Jiahua. Distinguished Chair Professor Li Dingguo shares his deep friendship with Dean Zhu and his mental journey of physics research. The content of the lecture explores the properties of elements and emergent phenomena, such as superconductivity and collective phenomena of brain nerves. Academician Li pointed out that the Cooper pair is the key to the formation of superconductivity. The film also mentions the Jansen phenomenon (Messner effect) interacting with superconductors and magnetic fields, and its typical applications. Research directions can be divided into top-down and bottom-up strategies. In addition, the field of high-temperature superconductor research is quite important and complex, and new discoveries are made every year. In the film, the speaker also mentioned flock behavior models and brain neuron research, as well as the emergence of new behaviors and activities in sociological research. Finally, issues such as neuronal thresholds and free radicals are explored, noting that nature works surprisingly well. This video explores the generation of new phenomena by increasing force strength and system complexity, and mentions last year&rsquo;s Nobel Prize-winning work on the spin-glass model. The speaker emphasized that nature can provide its own solutions and discussed chain reactions in life sciences. The film mainly talks about the problem of critical phenomena and explores three related questions. Although the answers are not easy to find, it points out that physicists need real data for analysis. In addition, the speaker discussed the phenomenon of superconductivity and the generation of Cooper Pair coherence, and mentioned that future superconductors may operate at higher temperatures. This presentation covers the relevance of energy issues to social development and introduces knowledge of group and emerging behaviors. ,</p>

<p>This video introduces the lectures given by the Hu Shih Foundation and Professor Wu Renshu, discussing the study of theft cases in the Qing Dynasty and related laws. In the past, everyday crimes were often neglected in criminal history research, but there is enough historical material for research today. Through case analysis, the film mentions the consideration of criminal responsibility and the situation of solving theft cases during the Qing Dynasty. Compared with the modern crime detection rate, the detection rate was low at that time. Criminological theories explain why the poor choose to steal. In addition, the film mentions the social factors that caused the increase of theft cases in Chongqing in the mid-19th century, and discusses the contradictions and conflicts among them. Finally, the problem of preserving local judicial archives is pointed out. The film mainly discusses research directions such as the methods of solving crimes and the role of the detective in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and points out that the identity of the detective is difficult to determine. In addition, widows in the Ming and Qing Dynasties were restricted by laws and customs, and common crimes were common in the Ming Dynasty. There are many cases of theft, and the family life is not difficult, the value of the items is low, and the punishment is light. It is difficult to catch thieves, there is a lack of evidence, and the actual punishment is unknown. It is recommended to raise a yellow dog to prevent theft. Professor Wu&rsquo;s lectures aroused enthusiastic responses, and the audience could communicate with him. ,</p>

<p>In the first of the five major lectures of the 110-year Knowledge Feast of the Central Concert Academy, academician Liang Gengyi was invited to give a speech, sharing the academic transformation and research results from mathematics to biostatistics. Academician Liang emphasized the difference between mathematics and statistics and the impact of education and biostatistics on human health. In addition, the film explains the Curtain Maier method and its application in the study of genes and survival rates, and explains the four main axes of public health and the concept of prevention. The speaker also emphasized the importance of equivalence and mutual care in global health, uneven distribution of vaccines and wearing masks during the epidemic. In terms of medical education reform, Yangming University shared the whole-person education experience, including the introduction of the admission time and the introduction of PBL teaching method. Finally, the importance of foreign pharmaceutical education system and personnel training is mentioned. This film mainly discusses the importance of promoting Chinese arts universities, the myth of research universities and the challenges facing higher education in Taiwan. It is pointed out that research and education should be closely integrated, and the way to improve the SCI ranking is to combine universities and medical schools. Taiwan&rsquo;s higher education is facing challenges, including declining birth rate, too many universities, insufficient funds and difficulties in recruiting talents, and the introduction of policies often lacks long-term planning. The future trend is distance and smart medical care, but excessive reliance on high technology may widen the gap between the rich and the poor. The presenter of the film shared his personal experience and discussed issues such as care for the elderly and medical education reform, emphasizing that the community, educators and doctors should pay close attention to and cooperate with each other. This film emphasizes the importance of seniors in developing young people and the need to maintain a young mind. Finally, he mentioned the health big data integration platform promoted by the Taiwan government, but reminded that there may be potential risks in over-reliance on big data. ,</p>

<p>The Academia Sinicaâ€™s 110-year knowledge experience event invited historian Lei Xiangning to discuss the impact of epidemics on human society. From unraveling the mystery of China&rsquo;s tuberculosis mortality rate in the 1930s, and introducing Dr. Wu Lien-teh, a Chinese medical scientist with anti-epidemic masks, to discussing issues such as the relationship between public health and identity, water sources and the spread of epidemics. Epidemic prevention measures not only promote new living appliances and hygiene habits, but also change people&rsquo;s body awareness, feelings, interpersonal relationships, boundaries and self-identity, and even ethical values. At the beginning of the 20th century, tinea proliferated in China and Japan, when medicine focused on the relationship between the family and the state. The film mentions that the process of epidemic prevention unconsciously strengthens identity, and the problem that the Chinese family food system may lead to serious diseases, and mentions the impact of 19th-century hygiene science on anatomical body definition. Finally, the concept of &ldquo;Hydrogenic Chinese Dining Table&rdquo; proposed by Taiwanese doctors and how to find a balance in modern civilization will be introduced. The video shared topics such as Korean dining habits, family changes, and the economy. The speaker mentioned that countries regard borders as a factor of security to strengthen internal solidarity, and pointed out that sanitary measures make borders more visible and have uncontrolled disease effects. At the same time, topics such as the conflict between national culture and liberalism, and the possible Western influence on Japanese dining styles are explored. Although the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have different health concepts, they both pursue people&rsquo;s awareness and health protection. Academician Liu Fang, chair professor of Taipei Medical University, will be invited for the next speech, with the theme &ldquo;From Housing to Longevity, Unlocking the Common Mechanism&rdquo;. ,</p>

<p>This lecture invited Qiu Zhonglin, a researcher from the Institute of History, to give a lecture on the history of fine whaling in Chinese history. The research materials are scattered in history books, local chronicles and notes, and the time span is from the Han Dynasty to the present. However, China&rsquo;s whale capture image data is relatively scarce, and traditional literati have limited understanding of the huge capture animals at sea. In ancient documents, some descriptions are different from the classification of modern natural history, showing that the classification method was more traditional at that time. Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, the description of the activities and classification of cetaceans on the sea has been relatively detailed. In Chinese history, there have been 176 records of beluga whale strandings, of which 112 were the most in the East China Sea, which may be due to the long coastline and the entry of two large rivers, the Yangtze River and the former Yangtze River. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the marine environment in the coastal areas was very good. The film explores the phenomena and causes of whale stranding in ancient China. Tidal effects and abundant fish resources may be the cause of whale stranding, but the scientific community is still inconclusive. The legend of Runyu describes that the golden fish veins are pushed ashore during the year of Runnian and matched with the zodiac. The phenomenon of fish stranding was widely concerned in ancient China, and there is a myth that whale stranding is regarded as punishment by the gods. It is worth noting that in the legend of giant fish, some giant fish are regarded as dragons. In the third year of Guangxu, there is also a record of capturing a giant fish of seven or eight feet. These legends and phenomena reflect the awe and curiosity of the ancient Chinese towards marine life. Kings can live up to 200 years and are regarded as mystical creatures, with some giant fish described falling from the sky and eventually dying. Among them, in the early Southern Song Dynasty, there are very detailed sacrificial records about the death of metal giant fish. Part of the golden meat was eaten, but more was made into oil, and the golden bones were used in the construction of bridges, temple beams and columns. During the Republic of China, most of the records of Jintun cutting and dispatching appeared after the middle of the Ming Dynasty, and concentrated in the north bank of the Yangtze River Estuary to Xiangshangan, Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Goldfish is mysterious in folklore, such as worshiping the Dragon King and falling into the dragon. However, the social climate and government interpretation behind these records remains unclear. Fewer images of goldfish are preserved, possibly because residents kept them unconsciously, or because fetishes should not be drawn or photographed.</p>
<p>There is no documented evidence for the exchange of goldfish fishing experience between Penghu and Japan. The Penghu marine population may have appeared after the Southern Song Dynasty, or earlier. They would catch goldfish, and most of them may be recorded. In the Ming Dynasty, there are records mentioning the need for fuel at sea, which may be related to Japan. In coastal areas, when goldfish appear, fishermen and ordinary people will think that there is a disaster. Since the Ming Dynasty, the appearance of goldfish in literature and records has a more negative connotation. This presentation explores the ambiguity of a group&rsquo;s provenance, documented relevance, and evaluation. The teacher emphasized that in the less positive situations this is often misinterpreted as imagery, but is not actually a good thing. Finally, thank the teacher for his wonderful sharing. ,</p>

<p>The Mediterranean diet can help prevent frailty by including enough plant foods such as vegetables, fruits, nuts and oils, which help maintain health and reduce inflammation. However, the Mediterranean diet cannot be fully applied in Taiwan, and we need to make appropriate adjustments according to our own conditions. The balanced dietary recommendations of the US-Japan Dietary Guidelines For the elderly, ensuring that nutrients and protein intake meet the standards can help maintain overall physiological function and muscle mass. For people whose calorie intake is less than 1500 calories, some adjustments should be made, such as appropriately increasing the intake of vegetables and fruits. In Taiwan&rsquo;s dietary recommendations for the elderly, food categories remain stable, but protein and fat should increase. International literature shows that nutrients such as vitamin B group, C, E, D and phytochemicals are related to the synthesis of neurotransmitters, especially vitamin B group has a significant effect on slowing down brain atrophy. The nutritional health survey found that the elderly with low cognitive function had low nutritional intake, including insufficient calories and protein. Therefore, the diet of the elderly should pay attention to nutritional balance, appropriately increase the intake of calories, trace elements, cholesterol, etc., and eat more protein-rich foods, such as fresh fruits, whole milk, fish and seafood. In addition, maintaining the habit of drinking tea and coffee can also help maintain cognitive function. The long-term goal is to prevent cardiovascular disease, and the short-term goal is to ensure adequate nutrition. To maintain a balanced diet, distribute six major food groups, including fruits and vegetables, nuts, seed rings, milk and protein-rich foods, with healthy tea drinks. Eat red meat in moderation and avoid extreme diets. Adjust food distribution according to individual calorie needs, and have a reasonable mix of staple foods, main dishes, vegetables and fruits. Three-dimensional plates can be used to assist in food distribution. Be creative and incorporate a variety of foods into your diet to create fun activities. Taking the elderly as an example, if you canâ€™t finish eating vegetables, you can chop them and mix them with eggs to make a vegetable and egg sandwich. Ensure the intake of fruits, and arrange the intake of fruits and juices according to personal appetite. In short, it is necessary to maintain a balanced and creative eating habit to ensure adequate nutrition. ,</p>

<p>This video discusses the differences in conservatism, tradition, and education between men and women. The presenter addressed the identification of being an adult as subjective or objective, and the transformation of teens and adults. At the same time, it also talks about how family structure and family experience affect the behavior and beliefs of adolescents and adults. For example, two-parent families have a higher percentage of college graduates, while non-two-parent families have a higher percentage of high school vocational graduates. In addition, it discusses Taiwan&rsquo;s low birth rate and the phenomenon of marriage and out-of-wedlock children, and mentions why young people lack the motivation to marry and have children. Finally, discuss the impact of parental divorce experience in adolescence on their marital behavior in adulthood, and propose related research topics. Overall, the film explores issues of education, family and society and their impact on personal development and family formation. In this film, the speaker explores the influence of family background on young people&rsquo;s marriage and childbearing. It is mainly pointed out that the intimate relationship of adolescents from divorced families may be negatively affected, and early divorce of parents has an impact on premarital pregnancy of children, but does not affect early marriage. In addition, family income and parent-child relationship have significant gender differences on adolescent marriage and childbearing. Male adolescents with higher family income and better relationships are more likely to marry and have children at the age of 28, while women with the same background are less likely to become pregnant before marriage or early marriage. Finally, it is pointed out that Taiwan and other East Asian societies have conflicts between modern and traditional values, and the interaction of personal resources and cultural norms needs to be considered at the same time. ,</p>

<p>The theme of this video is the impact of plant cell structure and gene mutation on plant reproduction and growth. The speaker, Dr. Zhao Guangyu, used Arabidopsis thaliana as a research model to introduce the principles of T-DNA insertion and other mutant strains, and discussed how to use plant materials to study genes that affect growth. It is mentioned in the film that the study of mutants can help to find the key genes involved in the flowering process of plants. Then it explained the key steps of plant cell interaction, pollen tube growth and double fertilization in the process of pollination, and mentioned the parts that still need to be further studied. Using special techniques (such as laser manipulation, confocal optical microscopy, etc.) to study the process of plant breeding, and finally share the T-DNA gene transfer technology and its application in plant gene research. This video introduces techniques such as splicing mechanism, gene introduction into plant cells by Agrobacterium, gene editing and EMS mutation to observe the stability of fluorescent protein in the genome. The speaker, Dr. Gao Guangyu, shared her study experience and research experience, emphasizing the importance of studying hard and developing good habits. He discussed issues such as the source of Iron Cannon Lily, the change of plant flowering time, etc., and advocated respecting nature in research and finding uses and values â€‹â€‹from it. At the same time, he also mentioned the research on the standards and aesthetic concepts of women&rsquo;s beauty in Ming and Qing Dynasties. ,</p>

<p>It is mentioned in the film that dietary changes can improve our physical health, such as increasing vegetable and fruit intake, using whole grains, etc. In the process of human aging, vitality and weakness are inseparable. We need to understand ways to take care of our bodies when we are young so we can look our best in old age. Frailty and disability are reversible. By changing our lifestyle and eating habits, we can walk on the road to health. When observing abnormal weight changes and weakened strength in the elderly, it should be noted that this may be a warning sign of frailty syndrome. Frailty is a health problem in older age characterized by symptoms such as weak hand grip, slow walking speed, weight loss and always feeling tired. The development of frailty is related to many factors such as genetic factors and environmental factors, which affect the decline of multiple system organ functions. Proper lifestyle, good nutrition and regular physical activity help maintain good health. With regard to protein intake, through nutritional assessment, it is recommended that the elderly should consume enough protein to maintain the body&rsquo;s needs. Patients with frailty have low protein intake and should consume an appropriate amount of protein according to body weight. The global recommendation for protein intake is 1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight. This value is based on the American and Japanese dietary guidelines, and all nutrients can meet the standards. However, older people who eat less may not be able to meet this standard. Deficiencies in nutrients such as protein, vitamin B12, vitamin C, and zinc can lead to debilitating conditions. The study found that if the elderly in Taiwan suffer from frailty, their diet patterns will be different. Frail people may still eat too much of staple foods and too little of protein and other nutrients. Therefore, dietary recommendations need to be adjusted for those who eat less to ensure that their metabolic needs are met. Taiwanese generally do not consume enough protein and lack dairy products as an important source of protein. Elderly people are especially prone to debilitating diseases. They eat more rice and less protein, milk, vegetables, fruits and fats, which affects their health. In addition, traditional white rice is not rich in nutrients, which can easily cause calorie deficiency. Therefore, it is particularly important to have a balanced diet and increase the intake of protein, milk and other foods. ,</p>

<p>This film mainly discusses the application of statistics in earthquake risk assessment, case-control study, EM algorithm and Kaplan-Meier curve, etc., and emphasizes its importance in public health, medicine, epidemiology and other fields. The video mentions how earthquake engineers use the EM algorithm to analyze surface acceleration for earthquake risk assessment and seismic design, and introduces the wide application of Kaplan-Meier curves in the biomedical field. At the same time, research by statisticians on reducing sampling error has also received attention. The film focuses on the challenges of big data in data integration and analysis. Taking the National Health Insurance Database and the National Health Survey as examples, it explains how to combine big data and fine-grained databases for analysis, and use probability and statistical methods to reduce sampling errors and improve forecasting Accuracy. This video introduces the excellent performance of the EM algorithm, which can handle missing values â€‹â€‹reasonably and obtain valid results. Attention should be paid to the amount of variation in data fusion, and seismic data should be considered to describe the variation factors of seismic paths. The EM algorithm can improve the maximization and optimization of the objective function, but the calculation complexity is high, the convergence speed is slow, and it depends on the initial parameters. The E-EM algorithm needs to rely on the initial parameters to make assumptions, and the strength of the new interval has little influence; the new interval can be calculated after convergence. Finally, I would like to remind you that the next Knowledge Feast will be held on May 29th. Distinguished researcher Wu Shixiong will give a lecture on the topic of &ldquo;the relationship between sugar molecules and life&rdquo;. ,</p>

<p>This video is the Academia Sinica&rsquo;s May Knowledge Feast Lecture, Dr. Wu Zhixiong was invited to share the relationship between sugar molecules and life. Glucose has multiple functions in the human body, such as energy source, ATP generation, structural role and cell message transmission. Cell surface carbohydrates also play an important role in cell-to-cell communication and protection. Dr. Wu talked about the relationship between carbohydrate antigen and blood type, and the application of anticoagulants in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The film discusses in depth acute coronary symptoms, diabetes, methanol toxicity, and mentions the 1918 Spanish flu and H1N1 flu viruses. In addition, the film highlights the problem of bacterial resistance and the importance of vaccination, and explores the reasons why Zongzi have difficulty digesting. Finally, the Logo of Kangzhi Technology was introduced: anti-disease and anti-aging, and explained the role of H and N in virus classification. This video explores the role of protein and polysaccharide antigens in the immune process. The speaker mentioned that H1-3 and H5-7 are the keys to human influenza and avian influenza respectively, and explained the relationship between EPO and the kidney and the possible anemia problems encountered by kidney dialysis patients. The video mentions that both bovine kidney essence and black fungus polysaccharides can activate macrophages, but research on polysaccharides has been slow because of their complex structures. The difference between polysaccharide vaccines and protein-conjugated vaccines is that polysaccharide vaccines only use polysaccharides and do not require protein carriers. The speaker mentioned that there are products targeting polysaccharide vaccines on the market, such as the 13-strain Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine. In addition, the issue of nosocomial infections and related measures to reduce nosocomial infections, such as hand washing and wearing masks, are discussed. Finally, the speaker explained how sugars are added to proteins, and discussed the importance of choosing a suitable Linker from a cellular and chemical perspective. Thanks to Professor Wu Zhixiong for sharing this speech. ,</p>

<p>In his speech at the Institute of Earth Sciences, researcher Lin Zhengxiong talked about the volcanic disaster risk in Taipei City and related records and early warning measures. Taking the ancient city of Pompeii as an example, it shows that the scenery beside the volcano is beautiful, but it is potentially dangerous. The threat of volcanic activity to humans depends on the characteristics of the volcano and the disaster prevention measures. This video discusses how to predict volcanic eruptions by observing seismic activity and deformation of the Earth&rsquo;s crust. In response to volcanic disasters, Taiwan has formulated corresponding business plans and is conducting a large-scale exploration project.</p>
<p>The coexistence of volcanoes and cities is also discussed in the film. Advances in technology allow us to better deal with and reduce risks. Researcher Lin emphasized the possible mutual triggering relationship between volcanoes and earthquakes, as well as the uncertainty and individuality of volcanic behavior. He argues that each volcano has a unique personality that makes long-term eruption prediction challenging. This film discusses the risks of volcanic activity, the S-wave shadow and P-wave haze phenomena, and studies of the volume and depth of magma chambers. Criteria for judging the degree of volcanic activity include recent eruptive records and the presence or absence of magma reservoirs. The early warning of future volcanic activity and landslide disaster still needs further research. It is mentioned in the film that Yellowstone Park in the United States is a typical super-large volcano. The problem of returning residents after a volcanic eruption is complicated. Usually, people will want to return home when the volcano is not smoking. Earthquake prediction is difficult, and the Tatun and Keelung submarine volcanoes are volcanic threats in northern Taiwan. The film also discusses the causes of soreness and related knowledge, and introduces the research on pain-sensing molecules and acid receptor molecules. ,</p>

<p>During the summer vacation, the volcanic issues in Taipei City and Pompeii caused heated discussions. The Legislative Yuan has incorporated volcanic disasters into the category of natural disasters, but Taiwan is still unfamiliar with volcanic disasters. Experts are worried about the geological problems in northern Taiwan, fearing that volcanic activity may trigger fault activity at the foot of the mountain and affect the Taipei metropolitan area. The Taipei Basin may face hazards from the eruption of Mount Qixing. In the past, it was believed that there would be no volcanic eruptions in Taiwan, but geologists discovered that Daling Volcano had volcanic activity, and Daling Volcano was considered a dormant volcano. The Ministry of Science and Technology proposed a four-year plan to determine the size, depth and location of the magma chamber. Scientists have set up an observatory at Taiwan&rsquo;s Datong Volcano and are using seismographs, crustal deformation and geochemical instruments aimed at picking up anomalous signals ahead of the eruption. Although it is impossible to predict the situation of volcanic eruption in the long term, it has certain predictive ability in the short term. Volcanic areas are rich in geothermal resources and tourism potential. This video discusses the possibility of Yangmingshan volcanic activity and related observations about volcanic cities, pointing out that Taipei City is a volcanic city, and it is necessary to prepare for countermeasures in advance. At present, there are only a few cases in the world, such as the Datong Volcanic Group in Taiwan, that use liquid material observation methods to analyze volcanic behavior. This video introduces the types, classification and eruption process of volcanoes, pointing out that volcanic eruptions are relatively easy to predict, but active and quiet changes are more difficult. The video mentions some ways to reduce earthquakes, but the implementation is risky. In addition, the film mentions the connection between the Beitou earthquake and plate movement, and argues that Japan has made progress in preventing volcanic disasters. Finally, the film explores issues such as crater lakes, the ecological impact of submarine volcanoes, and methods of volcanic dating. ,</p>

<p>In this sharing session, researchers who graduated from the Department of Chemistry at National Taiwan University introduced their research results for many years, exploring how neurons affect the life course in terms of development and genetics. The researchers used fruit flies and mice as research subjects to explore the influence of proneural genes on the formation of sensory organs. Cell competition and cooperation play important roles in the process of cell division and influence cell development; for example, achieving alignment, responding to environmental changes, etc. Research on brain plasticity, neuron function and apoptosis also shows that the progress of neuroscience is of great significance for understanding the process of disease development. In terms of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease research, researchers have used fruit flies to find drugs with palliative and therapeutic effects, and found that traditional Chinese medicine may also have a protective effect on Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. Researchers continue to explore the application potential of these chemical molecules. Researchers looking for a better combination of ingredients to curb the onset of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, point to unconstrained ideas that may be effective for some types of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. Studying behavioral changes in Drosophila allows for the observation of neurodegeneration linked to the axotomy process. Scientists stress the ethics of gender identity and gene editing research. Pegasus has a protective effect, but whether it can treat Parkinson&rsquo;s disease remains to be proven. Alzheimer&rsquo;s research has no definitive answer. This video emphasizes that exercise has a curative effect on Parkinson&rsquo;s and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, while coffee and smoking only have an associated protective effect. Finally, the film discusses the division of the optic nerve in processing visual information and the differences in human sensitivity to color. ,</p>

<p>The film mainly introduces the development and application of thermoelectric technology and thermoelectric materials, and emphasizes its importance in energy transition and energy efficiency improvement. Thermoelectric materials can be used in industries such as automobiles to improve energy efficiency, and can also be used in spacecraft, Mars exploration vehicles, etc. Different materials have their own properties at different temperatures.</p>
<p>However, the thermoelectric efficiency still needs to be improved, and more applications are found in alternative energy sources such as solar energy and wind energy. The government needs to actively develop renewable energy such as solar energy and wind energy to reduce dependence on energy that was no longer applicable in the past.</p>
<p>In the film, different modern technologies and power conversion challenges are also explored, such as OTEC technology that uses temperature differences to generate power, but the economics are yet to be improved. When discussing energy, it is necessary to consider the cost of power generation and economic benefits. Thermoelectric systems can increase efficiency and reduce prices. Although Germany and California invest in green energy, it is still difficult to replace nuclear energy in the short term. Different countries deal with nuclear waste in different ways. For example, India actively develops nuclear energy, and France adopts re-enrichment technology. For Taiwan, the problem of nuclear waste is serious, and the storage space is insufficient. It even considers reducing the production capacity of nuclear power plants. And Taiwan has achieved initial success in wind power generation. In addition, Taiwan&rsquo;s recycling achievements are closely related to voluntary organizations such as Tzu Chi, and have abundant methane ice resources. Research on space rockets can improve the country&rsquo;s international status. Finally, young people are called upon to participate in energy research. ,</p>

<p>The speaker of this event discusses the issues of privacy and privacy rights in the information society, and uses traditional architecture in Taiwan and the Florence Museum in Italy as examples to illustrate the understanding and changes in the concept of privacy in different social periods. The film compares the differences in the translation of privacy in different regions and delves into the spatial and legal aspects of privacy. The speaker emphasized that the modern concept of privacy is not only about protecting personal things and space, but also includes other meanings. At the same time, it points out that the cultural phenomenon of reporting is related to privacy issues, and discusses the different developments in privacy protection in various countries. In addition, it is emphasized that in the information society, the use of mobile phones and applications may lead to the leakage of personal data, which should be paid attention to. This video explores the importance of privacy in modern society and how to protect it. In the face of personal data collection problems brought about by digital technologies such as big data and AI, it emphasizes the protection of corporate transparency for personal privacy. Topics discussed included facial recognition technology, genetic recognition, media changes, and driving recorders, etc., and explained the balance between free flow of information and protection of personal privacy. The speaker emphasized that with the development of science and technology, the protection of personal privacy is particularly important, and called for the determination of social norms through empirical research and attention to the whereabouts of user information. In the age of the Internet of Things, the concept of privacy may change, and a balance needs to be struck among various interests. Finally, the speaker suggested that everyone should discuss and debate together to find a reasonable solution. ,</p>

<p>In this feast of knowledge speech, Dr. Xu Wenlian, director of the Institute of Information Science, was invited to introduce the research content and application in the field of artificial intelligence. Dr. Hui said that artificial intelligence has achieved many breakthroughs due to the development of deep learning, especially in speech recognition and natural language understanding. However, natural language understanding is considered the last hurdle of artificial intelligence, and computers have not yet fully understood human language. Dr. Hsu referred to the challenges of machine translation and language understanding, emphasizing skepticism and humility. In addition, IoT applications can improve the convenience of life, but robots still face challenges in areas such as customer service. This video proposes the concept of pattern matching (Pattern Matching) to improve the accuracy of speech recognition, and introduces how the Shenzhen division of labor teaches computers to understand professional terms and deal with the challenges of non-standard grammar. The film explores applications of linguistic phenomena such as spell checkers, auto-answering questions, and more. In addition, intelligent agent applications are introduced, such as automatic mail classification and reply, automatic scoring system, etc. The film mainly talks about the application of computers in life and work in terms of improving efficiency and reducing review costs. However, there are still certain obstacles for machines to create imaginative works such as novels and songs. The film also discusses how technology can be used to organize and structure ancient books. Finally, issues of database establishment and research funding are mentioned. Human creativity is critical in the development of science, but whether AI can learn creativity is still controversial. Experiments are underway in mathematics to allow computers to perform proofs, while data on the web may be used for analysis and personalized advertising. The potential use and security of future data remains a concern. ,</p>

<p>Director Hu Zhenzhen, who graduated from the Department of Literature at National Taiwan University, shared his research on women&rsquo;s novels in the Qing Dynasty in his speech, and discussed the status of women in ancient literature. Taking Li Qingzhao as an example, she was able to challenge the expectations and restrictions on women at that time, and influenced later generations of female literati. Female writers in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, such as Chen Duansheng, created Tanci novels with delicate styles and complex plots, which gave women more creative space. However, these women writers still struggled with the expectations and constraints of their families and society. The film analyzes the female characters and their psychology in works such as &ldquo;Rebirth&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hou Zhi&rdquo;, and explores how female authors express female psychology with delicate descriptions. Finally, the film mentions that when the female writer Liang Deshen completed Chen Duansheng&rsquo;s unfinished novel, she presented her delicate inner feelings from the perspective of a woman. This film explores gender issues and homosexual elements in ancient female poetry novels. &ldquo;Bishenghua&rdquo; and Li Guiyu&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liuhua Dream&rdquo; show the rationality of women facing difficulties and the phenomenon of wearing masks to face the future, and present women&rsquo;s indifference to marriage through emotional expression. For love and friendship, the heroines in the story disguise themselves as men and support each other on the battlefield. Through the scenes of women cross-dressing, homosexual relations were highlighted in the social context of the time, paving the way for the current discussion of gay literature and gay feelings. The film also explores the preservation process of women&rsquo;s novels and the presentation of gender identity issues in ancient texts. The speaker emphasized that homosexuality and gender identity need to be discussed separately, and thanked Chief Hu for his in-depth explanation, which gave the audience a better understanding of these issues. ,</p>
